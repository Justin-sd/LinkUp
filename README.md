# LinkUp
Linkup is a great way to create a meeting and collabrate with others to pick the best available time!
We allow users to create events and input their schedules. These schedules can then be compared allowing 
the organzier of the event to select the best time.

## Known Bugs
The list of available times doesn't properly update with the information on the calendar.

On the general unavailability page, if you put block out time manually then import with google calendar,
the manually inputted times are overwritten. 

You can create an event that has a longer duration than start time and end time. For example, if you have 3 hour duration you can have the start time be 10 am and end time be 11 am. 

Logout button on My Unavailability page doesn't work. 

On Change Name, if you don't enter anything for your name, your display name is now blank.

You can delete the event title and description and leave them blank. 

When you have an hour long event, the list on the bottom doesn't update the intervals.
